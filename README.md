# Vanilla JS + HTML Todo List

The same old todo list app, but without any library or framework, just plain vanilla JS and HTML.

## Why this

This little repo is meant to demonstrate how simple and powerful the DOM APIs are.

It can also give you a better understanding of what happens under the hood, now that nowadays we mainly work at a higher level with libraries and framework like React, jQuery, Angular and Vue.


## Run the app

```
yarn install && yarn start
```

## Run the tests

```
yarn test
```

or if you want to play with the Cypress UI:


```
yarn test:interactive
```
